# pino-multi-stream&nbsp;![CI](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-multi-stream/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

*pino-multi-stream* is a wrapper around the [pino][pino] logger. The purpose
of *pino-multi-stream* is to provide a stop-gap method for migrating from the
[Bunyan][bunyan] logger. Whereas *pino* allows only one destination stream,
*pino-multi-stream* allows multiple destination streams via the same
configuration API as Bunyan.

Please see the [caveats](#caveats) section for some important information
regarding the performance of this module.

## Install

For Pino v7+

```js
npm install -s pino-multi-stream
```

For Pino v5 and v6

```js
npm install -s pino-multi-stream@legacy
```

*pino-multi-stream* does not provide the CLI that *pino* provides. Therefore,
you should not install it globally.

<a id="usage"></a>
## Usage

```js
var fs = require('fs')
var pinoms = require('pino-multi-stream')
var streams = [
  {stream: fs.createWriteStream('/tmp/info.stream.out')},
  {level: 'fatal', stream: fs.createWriteStream('/tmp/fatal.stream.out')}
]
var log = pinoms({streams: streams})

log.info('this will be written to /tmp/info.stream.out')
log.fatal('this will be written to /tmp/fatal.stream.out')
```

## API

The API for *pino-multi-stream* is the same as that for *pino*. Please
read [pino's documentation][pinoapi] for full details. Highlighted here are
the specifics for *pino-multi-stream*:

+ The signature for constructor remains the same, `pino(opts, stream)`, but
  there are a few conditions under which you may get a real *pino* instance
  or one wrapped by *pino-multi-stream*:

  1. If the `opts` parameter is a writable stream, then a real *pino*
     instance will be returned.
2. If the `opts` parameter is an object with a singular `stream` property
     then a real *pino* instance will be returned. If there is also a plural
     `streams` property, the singular `stream` property takes precedence.
  3. If the `opts` parameter is an object with a plural `streams` property,
   does not include a singluar `stream` property, and is an array, then
     a *pino-multi-stream* wrapped instance will be returned. Otherwise,
     `opts.streams` is treated a single stream and a real *pino* instance
     will be returned.

+ The *pino* options object accepts a `streams` option, as alluded to in then
  previous item. This option should be an array of stream objects. A stream
  object is one with at least a `stream` property and, optionally, a `level`
  property. For example:

  ```js
  var logger = pinoms({
    streams: [
      {stream: process.stdout}, // an "info" level destination stream
      {level: 'error', stream: process.stderr} // an "error" level destination stream
    ]
  })
  ```

### pinoms.level set accessor

You can set the level to _all streams_ by changing the level property.
It accepts the same parameters as pino. If the level is changed on a
child logger, it does not alter the parent streams level. As this is
costly operation, we recommend not changing the level for each child
logger that is being created.

### pinoms.level get accessor

The behavior of the get accessor changes if `{ bunyan: true }` is passed
to pinoms. In that case, it implements the
[`bunyan.level`](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#levels) function.

### pinoms.prettyStream({ [prettyPrint],  [prettifier], [dest] })

Manually create an output stream with a prettifier applied.

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var pinoms = require('pino-multi-stream')

var prettyStream = pinoms.prettyStream()
var streams = [
    {stream: fs.createWriteStream('my.log') },
    {stream: prettyStream }
]

var logger = pinoms(pinoms.multistream(streams))

logger.info("HELLO %s!", "World")
```

The options object may additionally contain a `prettifier` property to define which prettifier module to use. When not present, `prettifier` defaults to [`pino-pretty` â‡—](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty) (must be installed as a separate dependency).

The method may be passed an alternative write destination, but defaults to `process.stdout`.

Prettifying options (after 4.2.0) are to be set like this:

```javascript
const prettyStream = pinoms.prettyStream(
{
 prettyPrint:
  { colorize: true,
    translateTime: "SYS:standard",
    ignore: "hostname,pid" // add 'time' to remove timestamp
  },
 prettifier: require('pino-pretty') // not required, just an example of setting prettifier
    // as well it is possible to set destination option
}
);
```

## Caveats

**Stern warning:** the performance of this module being dependent on the number
of streams you supply cannot be overstated. This module is being provided so
that you can switch to *pino* from *Bunyan* and get some immediate improvement,
but it is not meant to be a long term solution. We *strongly* suggest that you
use this module for only as long as it will take you to overhaul the way
you handle logging in your application. `pino-multi-stream` offers close
to zero overhead if _there is only one destination stream_.

To illustrate what we mean, here is a benchmark of *pino* and *Bunyan* using
"multiple" streams to write to a single stream:

```
benchBunyanOne*10000: 703.071ms
benchPinoMSOne*10000: 287.060ms
```

Now let's look at the same benchmark but increase the number of destination
streams to four:

```
benchBunyanFour*10000: 2249.955ms
benchPinoMSFour*10000: 1017.886ms
```

And, finally, with ten destination streams:

```
benchBunyanTen*10000: 4950.301ms
benchPinoMSTen*10000: 3127.361ms
```
